          <p>
            Determining a scope of hours for a large project that will be completed by a team of developers is difficult and leaves too high of a margin of error - and mistakes can be costly! Project
            Managers need a way to accurately determine the scope of a project in a way that accounts for differences in experience levels across a team.

          <h2>A Deeper Dive</h2>
          <h3>Design</h3>
          <p>
            We began the <stencil-route-link url="/services/app-designer">design process</stencil-route-link> by researching similar apps on the marketplace and identifying features we liked and did
            not like about them. We then set up user flows and wireframing each identified screen. This process, along with the design and styling phase, occurs in{' '}
            <stencil-route-link url="/toolbox">Sketch</stencil-route-link>. After completing the full skeleton, we reviewed each user flow and tried to identify any gaps or weaknesses in the user
            flow. From there, we made modifications and began identifying styles and colors for the app. We created a logo and a splash screen and applied the styles to the rest of the screens. We
            then created a working prototype in Marvel to aid our development team in the next phase and prepared for handoff.{' '}
          </p>
          <h3>Development</h3>
          <p>
            We began the <stencil-route-link url="/services/app-developer">development process</stencil-route-link> with a full design review. Our team worked closely with the designers to document a
            list of feature requirements that would later translate into development requirements. From there, we architected and established a base draft for client and server side implementation. We
            iterated through a review process as we gradually expanded and started to develop features.From our draft a skeleton client-side application is started in-tangent with developing
            server-side implementation to test and ensure all the data and state was expected and is functioning where it needs to be. Additional developers then followed in client-side to finalize
            pieces of the skeleton to reflect the designs. As each portion finished, it is formally reviewed, tested, and merged into a `master` branch for that app version. We reviewed these branches
            at critical milestones and had our quality assurance team review in order to ensure we stayed on top of bugs, in which we tracked in Github.
          </p>
          <h3>What we learned</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout the process of developing JuntoScope, <stencil-route-link url="/about">our team</stencil-route-link> learned the importance of establishing a process that is fully understood by
            each and every member. Our company was going through a transitional phase early on in the development of JuntoScope bringing on new team members and creating efficient processes. Towards
            the end of the session phase we discovered that the processes we established for work with our clients wasn't being diligently followed for JuntoScope.
            <br />
            <br />
            This included designs that were not fully reviewed and understood by our development team, designs that did not follow guidelines with consistent styles and symbols, and a lack of
            forethought into the user experience of people not familiar with the app. What made sense to or team did not make sense to new users. This goes back to the saying, if your user interface
            needs to be explained, it's no good.
            <br />
            <br />
            As our team came close to launching{' '}
            <a href="http://try.juntoscope.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
              JuntoScope
            </a>
            , we learned from Teamwork.com that they were changing the way their API worked and this forced us to go back to our design and development teams to work in the new authentication flows.
            This set our team back a few weeks from our initial planned launch. We learned the importance of staying up to date with technical updates to software that we integrate with so we
            immediately subscribed to their announcements.
            <br />
            <br />
            Designing and developing JuntoScope was a great learning experience for our team as we used this as a time for us to perfect our internal processes that make all of our subsequent products
            seamless. This has had a lasting impact on the quality of apps that we produce for our clients and ultimately has made us a better team.
